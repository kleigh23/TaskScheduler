# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I created this program to test my knowledge I gained on the programing language C#. I also thought it would be a good program that was more difficult but within my new knowledge. I also enjoyed trying to implement different things from the libraries that are available in the C# language. I also could see how learning this could help me better prepare for other programs in the future. 

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}
Its a Task Scheduler and reminder, so it prompts the user for a task name and then time to be reminded. Then when the time/date comes around it will display the task in the command line. It uses different libraries that are available in the C# language, and with this language it makes it so then if oyu wanted to you could use GUI intergration using Windows, Forms, or WPF.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wanted to create this software to test my knowledge not only on the C# language but also my programing knowledge. I have done something simular to this but at the same time not the same. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
